# Minute

A small LISP-like interpreter written in C.

## Getting Started

```sh
make clean
make
./interpreter
```

## TODO

[ ] Expand Native Functions
  [ ] Implement string functions
  [ ] Implement file I/O functions (initially just read)
  [ ] Figure out console I/O
[ ] Expand Data Types
  [ ] Array/List Object
  [ ] Dictionary Object (could just be wrapper around array)
  [ ] Have array/dicts be reference counted (or GCed)
  [ ] File object (this could be difficult)
